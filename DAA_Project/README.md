Introduction:
This project implements and compare the runtime of sorting algorithms based on given input size:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort 
4. Merge Sort
5. Heap Sort
6. Quick Sort

These algorithms take the various input size from the user and after random array and provide the sorted array.

It calculates the run time required for the algorithm for every sorting algorithm. We can also compare runtime of all sorting algorthims. 

Technologies: 
Below are the technologies used:
-> [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Version Python 3.10.3
-> [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): Version 17.1
